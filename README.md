## How it Works

- **Create a New Issue**: Each conversation begins by opening a new issue in the repository.  
  - Click the "Issues" tab at the top of the repository page.  
  - Select "New issue" to start a new conversation.  
- **Reply in Comments**: Each message or reply is posted as a comment under the issue.  
  - Click on the issue you want to continue discussing.  
  - Type your message in the comment box and click "Comment" to add to the conversation.  
- **Close the Issue**: When the conversation or discussion is concluded, close the issue.  
  - Select "Close issue" to mark the conversation as resolved or finished.  

> **Pro Tip**: You can reference other issues or pull requests in your conversation by mentioning their number (e.g., #123), or tag other users by using @username to get their attention.
